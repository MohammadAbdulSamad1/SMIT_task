Certainly! Let's create a program that checks whether a given year is a leap year or not. 
In the Gregorian calendar, a leap year occurs every 4 years, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400.
 Here's a Dart program for this:

Part-12
Var data type(a unique data type)
This data type checks itself and decides its data type during runtime based on the initial value we will store into this. If we store an integer itâ€™s data type will be int if we store double its data type will be double and for list it will be list.
